In JavaScript, a regular expression is simply a type of object that is used to match character combinations in strings

Two ways to create: 

1. use slashes: var regLiteral = /cat/

2. constructor: regCon = new RegExp("cat");


```java
 ^: caret
{}: curly braces
[]: square braces
(): Parentheses
```



​We want to allow the username to contain letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens. We also want to limit the number of characters in username so it does not look ugly.

Following meta characters +, * or ? are used to specify how many times a subpattern can occur.

```
*// Matches the preceding expression 0 or more times.
+//Matches the preceding expression 1 or more times.
*: star
+: plus
//
